# Data Visualization with Titanic Dataset

This notebook demonstrates data visualization techniques using the Titanic dataset. By employing libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, various relationships and patterns within the data are explored and presented visually.

## Libraries Used

- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib:** For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn:** For making statistical graphics.
- **Plotly:** For creating interactive plots.

## Skills Acquired

### Data Visualization
- Created various plot types using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Developed interactive visualizations with Plotly.
- Customized plots with different color palettes and styles.

### Data Analysis
- Explored relationships and patterns within the Titanic dataset.
- Grouped and compared data based on categorical variables like gender and class.

### Technical Proficiency
- Enhanced coding skills in Python for data visualization.
- Utilized libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

### Presentation
- Improved ability to present data insights through visual representation.
- Learned to interpret and communicate findings effectively through plots.

### Attention to Detail
- Focused on plot aesthetics, including size, labels, and legend positioning.
- Ensured clarity and readability of visualizations.

## Notable Visualizations

- Scatter plots showing the relationship between age and fare, grouped by gender.
- Bar plots illustrating the average age and fare by gender and class.
- Box and boxen plots to visualize age distribution based on gender and class.
- Interactive scatter plots using Plotly for dynamic data exploration.

## Conclusion

Through this exercise, I gained a comprehensive understanding of data visualization techniques and their importance in data analysis. The hands-on experience with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly has significantly improved my ability to uncover and communicate data patterns and insights.
